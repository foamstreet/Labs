Martin - array[5]
Pangloss - array[5]

Each season 0 to 4 rutabagas will grow 
(random num 0 - 4 to be picked each time)

Rutabagas start growing at index 0. If there is already a rutabaga growing at an index,
it will stay there and the new rutabaga will grow at the next index.

Ex:	Season 1: 1 new rutabaga
	[1, ***, ***, ***, ***]

	Season 2: 2 new rutabaga
	[1, 2, 2, ***, ***]

	etc..

Each rutabaga will be represented by the number of rutabagas grown that season.
*** - represents no rutabagas growing yet

Eventually there will need to be more spaces for rutabagas to grow than will fit in the garden.
At that point, the garden array will need to be resized.

Pangloss will double his array is it needs to be resized.
Martin will only increase the size of his array by 2, even if there are more than 2 rutabagas that season.

Simulate 40 seasons. During each resizing, indicate the new size of the array. 
There maybe multiple resizings per season.
